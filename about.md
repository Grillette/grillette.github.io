I'm a french student in Computer Science.

I've started to get some interest in IT and programing aged 17. I discovered Cyber Security slowly and start looking at some challenges from time to time.
I really started to involve myself into this field at the beggining of 2018. Since then, I never stopped learning and improving and that's what's so cool in infosec.
Learning a lot on [root-me](https://www.root-me.org/Grillette?lang=fr#0ca0306b7859c89f56e431064c559032 "Root-me") and trying different CTF with my [team](https://ctftime.org/team/53269 "ctftime") I try to improve on every aspect of Cyber Security because they're all so interesting.

This blog's purpose is to post some write-ups of different CTF challenges and maybe writting some articles to explain security related principle because the best way to be sure you fully understood something and you memorized it is to teach it.

Feel free to contact me for any question !
