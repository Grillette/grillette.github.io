Hello there !

I'm Grillette, a french pentester and I'm passionnate about infosec.

I've started to get some interest in IT and programing aged 17. I discovered Cyber Security slowly and start looking at some challenges from time to time.
I really started to involve myself into this field at the beggining of 2018.
I'm mostly using [root-me](https://www.root-me.org/Grillette?lang=fr "Root-me") and more recently [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/131142) to practice and learn new things.
I also like to try different CTF when I have some spare time.

This blog's purpose is to post some CTF writeups, solutions for HTB boxes and maybe writting some articles to explain some security stuff if I feel confident enough !

Feel free to contact me for any question !
